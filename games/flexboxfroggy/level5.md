Introducing the `align-items` property in order to ***align items vertically*** with several values : 
- `flex-start`: Items align to the top of the container.
- `flex-end`: Items align to the bottom of the container.
- `center`: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
- `baseline`: Items display at the baseline of the container.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fit the container.

# Exercise

:clipboard: Three frogs: one green, one yellow and one red. They are spotted on top left of the container. Their own lilypad seems to be spoted in same order on bottom left from the container.

:bulb: Basically just apply : 

```css
align-items: flex-end;
```
