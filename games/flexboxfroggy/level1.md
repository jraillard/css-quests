# Level 1 : justify-content

First the `flex` attribute &rarr; `display: flex;` allowing to turn on the ***flex mode*** for sub items.

Introducing also the `justify-content` property in order to ***align items horizontally*** with several values : 
- `flex-start`: Items align to the left side of the container.
- `flex-end`: Items align to the right side of the container.
- `center`: Items align at the center of the container.
- `space-between`: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- `space-around`: Items display with equal spacing around them.
