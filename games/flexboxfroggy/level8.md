# Level 8 : flex-direction

Introducing the `flex-direction` property in order to ***handle items order / direction*** with several values : 
- `row`: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
- `row-reverse`: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
- `column`: Items are placed top to bottom.
- `column-reverse`: Items are placed bottom to top.

# Exercise

:clipboard: Three frogs (green, yellow, red). Their lilypad on same row but starting from the end and in reverse order.

:bulb: Basically just apply : 

```css
flex-direction: row-reverse;
```
